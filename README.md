Kiwi Train Solution
I have worked to solve this Tech test by using Java Language.
before excuting the program I want to give the overview of the file input.csv
There are three types of inputs that can be given to this file. 
1st Pattern is distance,stop1,stop2 and so on. You can provide a series of stops to calculate distance. For example you want to calculate distance of distance of the route A-B-C, then you write distance,A,B,C
1ns Pattern is maximumStops, numberOfminstops,numberOfmaxstops,start,end for example if you want to calculate the maximum stops between C and C with minimum 0 stops and maximum 3 stops, the you will write maximumStops,0,3,C,C
3rd Pattern is maximumistance,numMaxDistance,start,end For example if you want to calculate maximum distance C to C with max of 30 then we write maximumdistance,30,C,C
